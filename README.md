# TextMazeSolver

Maze Solver that takes a maze from standard input where:

  wall:                       '='
  
  empty/available space:      '.'
  
  start position:             'S'
  
  goal position:              'G'

The program then outputs the solved maze path to standard output

Example Inputs and Outputs can be found in the tests folder
